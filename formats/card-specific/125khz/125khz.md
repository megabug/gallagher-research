# Cardax 125kHz

## About

Low-frequency (125kHz) Cardax cards use this format. The cards output manchested encoded data at a RF/32 clock speed (that is, there are 32 RF cycles per bit, giving a data rate of 125kHz / 32 ~= 3.9kHz)


## Format

These cards output a simple stream of bits:

First, the fixed sequence `0111111111101010` (`0x7FEA`) is emitted.

This is followed by the [8 byte cardholder credential data](../../cardholder/cardholder.md) that has been expanded so that every 8 bits are followed by the inverse of the least significant bit.

Finally, a 1 byte CRC of the (unexpanded) credential data follows, with settings:

* Initial value = 0x2C
* Polynomial = 0x107


## Example

### Encoding

Assume that we have the same cardholder credential data as given in the encoding example [here](../../cardholder/cardholder.md#Decoding), that is (RC 0 (A), FC 9876, CN 1234, IL 1). Using the procedure described there, we get the final encoded data of `0xA397935AA380A349`.

Then this is output by a 125kHz card as follows:

* Fixed sequence: `0111111111101010`

* Expanded cardholder credential bytes:
  - `A3` -> `10100011 0`
  - `97` -> `10010111 0`
  - `93` -> `10010011 0`
  - `5A` -> `01011010 1`
  - `A3` -> `10100011 0`
  - `80` -> `10000000 1`
  - `A3` -> `10100011 0`
  - `49` -> `01001001 0`

* CRC: `00101011` (0x2B)

Collating these bits up into bytes, we get the value: `0x7FEAA34BA4CB5A34068C922B`.

### Decoding

Take the following bitstream from a card:

```
011111111110101010100011010001010110001010101001
011010100011010100011010100011000101100111010010
```

As expected, the first 12 bits are the fixed sequence `0111111111101010`. We can then split out the expanded cardholder credential bytes as

```
101000110100010101100010101010010110101000110101000110101000110001011001
```

and the CRC as `11010010`.

Aligning the expanded bytes as done in the encoding section gives:

```
10100011 0
10001010 1
10001010 1
01001011 0
10100011 0
10100011 0
10100011 0
00101100 1
```

As expected, each byte of the original cardholder credential data is followed by the inverse of its least significant bit, which we can discard. This gives the cardholder data `0xA38A8A4BA3A3A32C`.

The CRC, 0xD2, matches what is expected for the CRC over the data `0xA38A8A4BA3A3A32C`.

Finally, we can decode the cardholder data using the procedure outlined [here](../../cardholder/cardholder.md#Example). There, we can see that the encoded cardholder data `0xA38A8A4BA3A3A32C` corresponds to the cardholder credential (RC 4 (D), FC 2222, CN 1111, IN 3) (and all unknown fields set to 0).
