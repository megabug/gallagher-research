# This makefile depends on Arduino-Makefile
# (https://github.com/sudar/Arduino-Makefile).
#
# You will need to set the ARDMK_DIR variable to the location of
# Arduino-Makefile. Additionally, you will probably want to set some other
# variables used by Arduino-Makefile (i.e. BOARD_TAG, BOARD_SUB and
# MONITOR_PORT).
#
# For example, first set ARDMK_DIR:
#   On Debian:
#     `export ARDMK_DIR=/usr/share/arduino`
#   On macOS with Homebrew:
#     `export ARDMK_DIR=/usr/local/Cellar/arduino-mk/[version]`
# Then compile and upload the sketch (e.g. for an Arduino Nano):
#   `BOARD_TAG=nano BOARD_SUB=atmega328 MONITOR_PORT=/dev/tty.usbserial-XXXXXXXX make upload`

include $(ARDMK_DIR)/Arduino.mk
